    <h2>GET FLASH!</h2>
<p>If you can't see the above, then read this!</p>
<p>Due to Adobe Flash Player's retirement, you will need to install Adobe Flash Player onto your computer and patch out the date check with  FlashPatch, along with a companion browser.</p>

<p>Why do I need to install another browser? Most mainstream browsers dropped support for Adobe Flash Player along with the plugin interfaces that it used (PPAPI and NPAPI). As such, you will need to acquire an older browser.</p>

<p>Please note that when using Flash:</p>

<p>1. Flash may perform poorly on lower end PCs, and generally could cause the page to be unresponsive</p>
<p>2. Some newer versions of Flash might be slower / glitchier</p>

<p>CleanFlash download: https://cdn.cleanflash.org/CleanFlash_34.0.0.308_Installer.exe</p>

<p>You can either download:</p>

<p>1. Waterfox Classic: https://classic.waterfox.net/</p>

<p>2. Pale Moon: https://www.palemoon.org/download.shtml</p>

<p>Alternatives?</p>
<p>We are aware of the Ruffle project, but it does not work that well with YDKJ 6.</p>
